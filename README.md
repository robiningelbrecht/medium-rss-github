# Medium RSS feed on your GitHub README

I used <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/add-your-recent-published-mediums-article-on-github-readme-9ffaf3ad1606" target="_blank">following solution</a> 
to dynamically display my Medium articles on my GitHub profile, but the app does not seem to work anymore.
That's why I decided to create a clone. Feel free to use it on your own profile as well

```
https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@YourUserName/article-index/
```

Specific example to display my own most recent Medium article:

```
https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/2/
```

Live demo: <a href="https://github.com/robiningelbrecht">https://github.com/robiningelbrecht</a>

If you decide to use the app, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê
