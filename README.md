# Medium RSS feed on your GitHub README

I used <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/add-your-recent-published-mediums-article-on-github-readme-9ffaf3ad1606" target="_blank">following solution</a> 
to dynamically display my Medium articles on my GitHub profile, but the app does not seem to work anymore.
That's why I decided to create a clone. Feel free to use it on your own profile as well.


* Display one Medium article and link to the external Medium page

```
[![Example](https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/0/)](https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/0/link)
```

[![Example](https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/0/)](https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/0/link)

* Display multiple Medium articles and link to your profile page

```
[![Example](https://medium-rss-github.vercel.app/@ingelbrechtrobin/0,1,2,3,4/)](https://ingelbrechtrobin.medium.com/)
```

If you decide to use the app, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê
